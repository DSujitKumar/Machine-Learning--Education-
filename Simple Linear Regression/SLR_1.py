"""
Some Simple points to remember:-
    1. Regression provides contineous outputs.
    2. The distance between actual points and the hyperplane is called Residue.
    3. Error = Sum Squired Error
        Mathematically =Σ(predicted - actual)^2 = Σ(residue)^2
    4. Minimun residue Value is the Best model.
    5. Mathematicaly 'y = mx+c'.
